# Main Character Generator
Website that lets users put any name into the movie summaries of their favorite movies. You can either pick from a list of movies, or enter the title and the year it was released to get a customized summary.

# How it Works
Uses JavaScript and React to access the MediaWiki API for movie summaries and cast, then parses the strings to insert the name in place of the first and last name of the main character.
